;;; Recall that in the dictionary entry for LOOP, the HyperSpec says:
;;;
;;;   main-clause ::= unconditional | 
;;;                   accumulation |
;;;                   conditional |
;;;                   termination-test |
;;;                   initial-final
;;;
;;; Though here, we exclude initial-final so that we have:
;;;
;;;   main-clause ::= unconditional | 
;;;                   accumulation |
;;;                   conditional |
;;;                   termination-test
;;;
;;; Furthermore, the HyperSpec defines selectable-clause like this:
;;;
;;;   selectable-clause ::= unconditional | accumulation | conditional 
;;;
;;; so we can say:
;;;
;;;    main-clause ::= selectable-clause | termination-test
