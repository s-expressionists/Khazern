;;; is itself a list of three elements.  The first element is the name
;;; of a variable used in an INTO clause, or NIL if the clause has no
;;; INTO.  The second element determines the kind of accumulation, and
;;; can be one of the symbols LIST, COUNT/SUM, or MAX/MIN.  The third
;;; element is a type specifier which can be T.
